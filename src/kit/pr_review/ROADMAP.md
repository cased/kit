# Kit Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned features and improvements for kit, prioritized by user feedback and strategic value.

## ðŸš¢ Recent ships

#### Per-User/Per-Organization Custom Context
Store custom guidelines, coding standards, and preferences that get automatically included in reviews.

```bash
# Example usage
kit profile create --name "company-standards" --file coding-guidelines.md
kit review --profile company-standards <pr-url>
```

Now in `0.7.0`.

## ðŸ“… Planned Features

#### Feedback Learning System
Simple database to store review feedback and adapt over time.

```bash
# Example feedback workflow
kit review <pr-url>  # Generates review
kit feedback <review-id> --helpful/--not-helpful --notes "Missed performance issue"
kit insights  # Show what's working well
```

#### Inline Comments & GitHub Review API
Post comments directly on specific lines instead of single review comment.

```bash
kit review <pr-url> --mode inline  # Line-by-line comments
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Medium Term

#### Multi-Model Consensus
Route different aspects to different models and aggregate insights.

```bash
kit review <pr-url> --consensus  # Use multiple models, combine results
```

#### Repository Context Learning
Learn which types of context are most valuable and adapt automatically.

#### IDE Integration
Real-time suggestions in VS Code and other editors while coding.
