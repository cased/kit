# Kit PR Review Examples

Real-world examples of Kit AI-powered code reviews on open source projects, demonstrating analysis across different types of changes and model cost/quality trade-offs.

## üìÅ Examples Overview

### Individual PR Reviews

| Example | Repository | Type | Cost | Key Insights |
|---------|------------|------|------|--------------|
| [FastAPI Standard Dependencies](fastapi_11935_standard_dependencies.md) | tiangolo/fastapi | Major packaging change | $0.0340 | Architectural impact analysis |
| [React.dev Branding Menu](react_dev_6986_branding_menu.md) | reactjs/react.dev | Frontend UI feature | $0.0118 | Accessibility focus |
| [Biopython Documentation Fix](biopython_204_documentation_fix.md) | biopython/biopython.github.io | Simple doc fix | $0.0064 | Proportional response |

### Model Comparisons

| Example | Focus | Price Range | Models Compared |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| [Multi-Model FastAPI Analysis](model_comparison_fastapi_11935.md) | Cost vs Quality | $0.005 - $0.91 | GPT-4.1-nano to Claude Opus 4 |

## üéØ Key Demonstrations

### 2. **Ridiculous Value at Ultra-Low Costs**
- **GPT-4.1-nano**: $0.005 per large PR - genuinely useful reviews for virtually nothing
- **Monthly costs on decent models**: $0.46 for 100 PRs with budget models
- **Top quality**: $87.95/month (yes) for 500 PRs with best-recommended model and settings

### 3. **Professional Quality Analysis**
- Identifies specific issues with file/line references
- Provides concrete code improvement suggestions
- Considers broader architectural and ecosystem impact
- Includes security, performance, and accessibility considerations

## üìä Real Cost Data

Based on actual testing on production open source PRs:

### Typical Costs by PR Size
- **Small PR (1-3 files)**: $0.005 - $0.02
- **Medium PR (4-8 files)**: $0.01 - $0.05  
- **Large PR (9+ files)**: $0.02 - $0.20

### Model Comparison (Large PR)
| Model | Cost | Quality | Best For |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| GPT-4.1-nano | $0.005 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | High-volume, budget-conscious |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $0.18 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Production teams |
| Claude Opus 4 | $0.91 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Critical infrastructure |

## üöÄ What Makes These Reviews Valuable

### Beyond Syntax Checking
- **Repository Context**: Understands how changes affect the broader codebase
- **Symbol Analysis**: Identifies when functions/classes are used elsewhere
- **Impact Assessment**: Considers effects on users, tutorials, ecosystem
- **Best Practices**: Suggests improvements aligned with modern development standards

### Professional Focus Areas
- **Security**: Identifies potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces
- **Performance**: Flags issues that could impact speed or resource usage  
- **Accessibility**: Ensures UI changes work for all users
- **Maintainability**: Suggests patterns that improve long-term code health
- **Documentation**: Emphasizes clear communication and user experience

### Quality Assurance
- **Objective Scoring**: Each review includes quality metrics
- **Reference Validation**: Ensures suggestions point to actual changed files
- **Specificity Analysis**: Measures concrete vs vague feedback
- **Coverage Assessment**: Validates that major changes are addressed

## üí° Lessons Learned
