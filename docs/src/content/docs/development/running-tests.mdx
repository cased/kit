title: Running Tests
---

To run tests using uv and pytest, first ensure you have the development dependencies installed:

```sh
# Install all deps
uv pip install -e .
```

Then, run the full test suite using:

```sh
uv run pytest
```

Or to run a specific test file:

```sh
uv run pytest tests/test_hcl_symbols.py
```

## Code Style and Formatting

Kit uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting, formatting, and import sorting with a line length of 120 characters. Our configuration can be found in `pyproject.toml`.

To check your code against our style guidelines:

```sh
# Run linting checks
ruff check .

# Check format (doesn't modify files)
ruff format --check .
```

To automatically fix linting issues and format your code:

```sh
# Fix linting issues
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

These checks are enforced in CI, so we recommend running them locally before pushing changes.
