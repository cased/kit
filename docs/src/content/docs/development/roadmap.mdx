description: What we're working on and where kit is headed

This roadmap reflects our current priorities. Updated quarterly.

## Recently Shipped

**3.0.0 (December 2025)**
- Go dependency analyzer with full module support
- 38x faster repository operations (Rust-based file walker)
- Chroma Cloud integration for team-shared semantic indexes

**2.2.0 (November 2025)**
- Grok (X.AI) and GPT-5 model support
- Ripgrep integration for 10x faster code search
- Windows UTF-8 encoding fixes

## Now / Next

**Dependency Analysis Expansion**
- ~~JavaScript/TypeScript (package.json, ESM/CJS imports)~~ ✓ Shipped
- Rust (Cargo.toml, mod system)
- Java (Maven pom.xml, Gradle)

**Core Improvements**
- Multi-repo support — analyze relationships across repositories
- Monorepo awareness — npm/pnpm workspaces, Cargo workspaces
- Cross-file impact analysis — understand how changes propagate
- Incremental index updates — avoid full rebuilds

## Exploring

These are ideas we're considering. No commitments.

- **Call graph analysis** — who calls what, trace execution paths
- **API surface extraction** — public exports vs internal code
- **LSP server** — bring kit intelligence to any editor
- **Agentic review** — multi-pass, tool-using code review
- **Framework patterns** — Django, React, Rails-specific intelligence
