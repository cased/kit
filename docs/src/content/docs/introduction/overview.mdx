## kit: Code Intelligence Toolkit

A modular, production-grade toolkit for codebase mapping, symbol extraction, code search, and LLM-powered developer workflows. Supports multi-language codebases via `tree-sitter`.

`kit` features a "mid-level API" to build your own custom tools, applications, agents, and workflows: easily build code review bots, semantic code search, documentation generators, and more.

`kit` is **free and open source** with a permissive MIT license. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/cased/kit).

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

```bash
uv pip install cased-kit

# With ML features for advanced analysis and vector search
uv pip install 'cased-kit[all]'
```

### Install Globally with uv (easiest for CLI usage)

If you want to use the `kit` CLI globally without affecting your system Python, use `uv tool install`. This creates an isolated environment for `kit` while making the CLI available from anywhere:

```bash
# Install the base kit CLI globally
uv tool install cased-kit

# Everything (including MCP server and all features)
uv tool install cased-kit[all]
```

After installation, the `kit` and `kit-dev-mcp` commands will be available globally. To manage your uv tool installations:

```bash
# List installed tools
uv tool list

# Uninstall if needed
uv tool uninstall cased-kit
```

## Why Use kit?

`kit` helps with:

*   **Unifying Code Access:** Provides a single, consistent `Repository` object to interact with files, symbols, and search across diverse codebases, regardless of language.
*   **Deep Code Understanding:** Leverages `tree-sitter` for accurate, language-specific parsing, enabling reliable symbol extraction and structural analysis across an entire codebase.
*   **Bridging Code and LLMs:** Offers tools specifically designed to chunk code effectively and retrieve relevant context for large language models, powering smarter AI developer tools.

## Core Philosophy

`kit` aims to be a **toolkit** for building applications, agents, and workflows.
It handles the low-level parsing and indexing complexity, and allows you to adapt these components to your specific needs.

We believe the building blocks for code intelligence and LLM workflows for developer tools should be free and open source,
so you can build amazing products and experiences.

## LLM Documentation

This documentation site provides generated text files suitable for LLM consumption:

- [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt): Entrypoint file following the llms.txt standard.
- [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt): Complete documentation content concatenated into a single file.
- [`/llms-small.txt`](/llms-small.txt): Minified documentation content for models with smaller context windows.
