## kit: Code Intelligence Toolkit

A modular, production-grade toolkit for codebase mapping, symbol extraction, code search, and LLM-powered developer workflows. Supports multi-language codebases via `tree-sitter`.

Features a "mid-level API" to build your own custom tools, LLM workflows, and automation: easily build code review bots, semantic code search, documentation generators, and more.

## Why Use kit?

Working directly with code across different languages and tools can be complex. `kit` simplifies this by:

*   **Unifying Code Access:** Provides a single, consistent `Repository` object to interact with files, symbols, and search across diverse codebases, regardless of language.
*   **Deep Code Understanding:** Leverages `tree-sitter` for accurate, language-specific parsing, enabling reliable symbol extraction and structural analysis.
*   **Bridging Code and LLMs:** Offers tools specifically designed to chunk code effectively and retrieve relevant context for large language models, powering smarter AI developer tools.

## Core Philosophy

`kit` aims to be a **mid-level toolkit**. It handles the low-level parsing and indexing complexity but provides flexible building blocks rather than highly opinionated, end-to-end applications. The central `kit.Repository` object serves as your primary interface for accessing codebase intelligence.

## Where to Go Next
