# Overview

## kit: Code Intelligence Toolkit

A modular, production-grade toolkit for codebase mapping, symbol extraction, code search, and LLM-powered developer workflows. Supports multi-language codebases via `tree-sitter`.

Features a "mid-level API" to build your own custom tools, LLM workflows, and automation: easily build code review bots, semantic code search, documentation generators, and more.

## What You Can Build

- **AI-powered code review bots** — Automatically review code changes using LLMs and extracted code context.
- **Semantic code search** — Search for symbols, functions, or patterns across multi-language repos.
- **Automated documentation generators** — Extract code structure and docstrings to build up-to-date docs.
- **Codebase summarizers** — Summarize files, modules, or entire repos for onboarding or LLM context.
- **Dependency graph visualizers** — Visualize code relationships and dependencies for better understanding.
- Multi-language symbol extraction, chunking, and more for Python, JS, Go, HCL, etc.
