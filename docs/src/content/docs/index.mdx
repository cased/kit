Welcome to **Kit** â€“ a production-ready toolkit for building developer tools and AI-powered workflows on top of any codebase. Kit gives you:

- A unified `Repo` API for file trees, symbol extraction, fast text search, and vector search.
- Language-agnostic symbol extraction powered by **tree-sitter** queries.
- Ready-made utilities for chunking code, finding symbol usages, dependency mapping, and more.
- A flexible foundation for apps like semantic search, auto-docs, AI pull-request reviewers, and refactoring helpers.
