Welcome to **kit** â€“ the Python toolkit for building LLM-powered developer tools and workflows. Understand, 
search, and prepare code to with the goal of **whole repo context**.

*   **Map any codebase:** Get a structured view with file trees, language-aware symbol extraction (powered by tree-sitter), and dependency insights.
*   **Powerful Search:** Combine fast text search with semantic vector search to find relevant code snippets instantly.
*   **Build AI Workflows:** Leverage ready-made utilities for code chunking, context retrieval, and interacting with LLMs.

Use kit to build AI-powered developer tools (code reviewers, code generators, even IDEs) enriched with the right code context.
