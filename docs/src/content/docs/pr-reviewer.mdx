# Kit AI Code Reviewer & Summarizer

Kit includes a **production-ready AI code reviewer and summarizer** that provides professional-grade analysis with full repository context. Review GitHub PRs or local git diffs without creating a PR.
Use almost any LLM and pay just for tokens. High-quality reviews with SOTA models like Claude Sonnet 4 generally cost about 10 cents, while summaries cost just pennies.

Use per-organization profiles and prioritization for further customization. Use kit's local output to pipe to other unix tools.

<Aside type="tip">
**Want to build a completely custom reviewer?** See the [Build an AI PR Reviewer tutorial](/tutorials/ai_pr_reviewer) to create your own using kit's components.
</Aside>

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install kit (lightweight - no ML dependencies needed for code review!)
pip install cased-kit

# 2. Set up configuration
kit review --init-config

# 3. Set API keys
export KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"  # For GitHub PRs
export KIT_ANTHROPIC_TOKEN="sk-ant-your_key"  # For Anthropic (default)
export KIT_OPENAI_TOKEN="sk-openai-your_key"  # For OpenAI
export KIT_GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSy-your_google_key"  # For Google

# 4a. Review any GitHub PR
kit review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 4b. Review local changes (no PR needed!)
kit review main..feature           # Compare branches
kit review HEAD~3..HEAD            # Review last 3 commits
kit review --staged                # Review staged changes

# 4b. For OpenAI users: specify provider
kit review --model gpt-4.1 https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
# Or edit ~/.kit/review-config.yaml to set: llm.provider: openai

# 5. Test without posting (dry run with full formatting)
kit review --dry-run https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 6. Use custom context profiles for organization standards
kit review --profile company-standards https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 7. Focus on specific priority levels
kit review --priority=high,medium https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 8. Quick PR summaries for triage (5-10x cheaper)
kit summarize https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 9. Add summary to PR description for team visibility
kit summarize --update-pr-body https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

<Aside type="tip">
**GitHub Actions Users**: When running in CI/CD, checkout the repository first and use `kit review --repo-path .` to avoid authentication issues. See our [CI/CD guide](/pr-reviewer/cicd) for details.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
**Just want the PR reviewer?** The base `pip install cased-kit` gives you everything needed for PR reviews without heavy ML dependencies like PyTorch. If you need semantic search features later, install with `pip install cased-kit[ml]`.
</Aside>

## 💰 Transparent Pricing

Kit now uses **real-time pricing data** from [Helicone's API](https://www.helicone.ai/llm-cost) (300+ models), ensuring costs are always accurate. No more manual updates when providers change their rates!

Some examples based on real-world testing on production open source PRs:

| Model | Typical Cost | Quality | Best For |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **gemini-1.5-flash-8b** | **$0.003** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Ultra-budget, high volume |
| **gpt-4.1-nano** | **$0.0015-0.004** | ⭐⭐⭐ | High-volume, ultra-budget |
| **gpt-4.1-mini** | **$0.005-0.015** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Budget-friendly, often very good for the price |
| **gemini-2.5-flash** | **$0.007** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent value, fast |
| **claude-sonnet-4** | **0.08-$0.14** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Recommended for most** |

**PR Summaries** (for triage): ~$0.005-0.02 per summary (5-10x cheaper than reviews)

### In Practice

Even without optimizing your model mix, a team doing 500 large PRs a month will generally pay under $50 a month total for reviews with SOTA models.

<Aside type="tip">
Don't underestimate the smaller models. gpt-4.1-mini delivers surprisingly useful reviews *when given the right context via kit*. For simple projects, you can get decent AI code reviews for **less than $1/month**. Here's an example [against kit itself](https://github.com/cased/kit/pull/56#issuecomment-2928399599). This review cost *half a cent*.

## 📄 PR Summaries for Quick Triage

For teams that need to **quickly understand PRs before committing to full reviews**, kit includes fast, cost-effective PR summarization:

```bash
# Generate a quick summary
kit summarize https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Add the summary directly to the PR description
kit summarize --update-pr-body https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Use budget models for ultra-low-cost summaries
kit summarize --model gpt-4.1-nano https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

### Why Use PR Summaries?

- **5-10x cheaper** than full reviews (~$0.005-0.02 vs $0.01-0.05+)
- **Perfect for triage**: Understand what a PR does before deciding on detailed review
- **Team visibility**: Add AI summaries directly to PR descriptions for everyone to see
- **Same repository intelligence**: Leverages symbol extraction and dependency analysis

### Summary Output Format

Summaries provide structured information in a consistent format:

- **What This PR Does**: 2-3 sentence overview of the main purpose
- **Key Changes**: Most important modifications (max 5 bullet points)  
- **Impact**: Areas of codebase affected and potential risks/benefits

### PR Body Updates

The `--update-pr-body` option adds a marked AI summary section to the PR description:

```markdown
<!-- AI SUMMARY START -->

## What This PR Does
[AI-generated overview]

## Key Changes
- [Key modifications]

## Impact
- [Impact analysis]

*Generated by kit v0.7.1 • Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514*
<!-- AI SUMMARY END -->
```

**Smart handling**: Re-running with `--update-pr-body` replaces the existing summary instead of duplicating it.

## 📋 Custom Context Profiles

Store and apply **organization-specific coding standards and review guidelines** through custom context profiles. Create profiles that automatically inject your company's coding standards, security requirements, and style guidelines into every PR review.

```bash
# Create a profile from your existing coding guidelines
kit review-profile create --name company-standards \
  --file coding-guidelines.md \
  --description "Acme Corp coding standards"

# Use in any review
kit review --profile company-standards https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# List all profiles
kit review-profile list
```

→ **[Complete Profiles Guide](/pr-reviewer/profiles)** - Profile management, team workflows, and examples

## 🏠 Local Diff Reviews (No PR Required!)

Review code changes locally without creating a GitHub PR. Perfect for pre-commit reviews, work-in-progress checks, or private repositories:

```bash
# Review changes between branches
kit review main..feature
kit review develop..my-branch

# Review recent commits
kit review HEAD~3..HEAD    # Last 3 commits
kit review abc123..def456  # Specific commit range

# Review staged changes before committing
kit review --staged

# Combine with other options
kit review --plain main..feature | claude "Should I merge this?"
kit review --priority=high HEAD~1..HEAD
kit review --model gpt-4.1-mini --staged
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Privacy**: Review sensitive code without pushing to GitHub
- **Speed**: Instant reviews without PR creation overhead
- **Workflow**: Integrate into pre-commit hooks or local development
- **Cost**: Same transparent pricing as PR reviews

**Local reviews are saved to**: `~/.kit/reviews/` for future reference
