# Kit AI PR Reviewer

Kit includes a **production-ready AI PR reviewer** that provides professional-grade code analysis with full repository context. 
Use almost any LLM and pay just for tokens. High-quality reviews with SOTA models like Claude Sonnet 4 generally cost about 10 cents.

Use per-organization profiles and prioritization for further customization. Use kit's local output to pipe to other unix tools.

<Aside type="tip">
**Want to build a completely custom reviewer?** See the [Build an AI PR Reviewer tutorial](/tutorials/ai_pr_reviewer) to create your own using kit's components.
</Aside>

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install kit (lightweight - no ML dependencies needed for PR review!)
pip install cased-kit

# 2. Set up configuration
kit review --init-config

# 3. Set API keys
export KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
export KIT_ANTHROPIC_TOKEN="sk-ant-your_key"
export KIT_OPENAI_TOKEN="sk-openai-your_key"
export KIT_GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSy-your_google_key"

# 4. Review any GitHub PR
kit review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 5. Test without posting (dry run with full formatting)
kit review --dry-run https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 6. Use custom context profiles for organization standards
kit review --profile company-standards https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 7. Focus on specific priority levels
kit review --priority=high,medium https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

<Aside type="tip">
**Just want the PR reviewer?** The base `pip install cased-kit` gives you everything needed for PR reviews without heavy ML dependencies like PyTorch. If you need semantic search features later, install with `pip install cased-kit[ml]`.
</Aside>

## üí∞ Transparent Pricing

Some examples based on real-world testing on production open source PRs:

| Model | Typical Cost | Quality | Best For |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **gemini-1.5-flash-8b** | **$0.003** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Ultra-budget, high volume |
| **gpt-4.1-nano** | **$0.0015-0.004** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | High-volume, ultra-budget |
| **gpt-4.1-mini** | **$0.005-0.015** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Budget-friendly, often very good for the price |
| **gemini-2.5-flash** | **$0.007** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Excellent value, fast |
| **claude-sonnet-4** | **0.08-$0.14** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | **Recommended for most** |

### In Practice

Even without optimizing your model mix, a team doing 500 large PRs a month will generally pay under $50 a month total for reviews with SOTA models.

<Aside type="tip">
Don't underestimate the smaller models. gpt-4.1-mini delivers surprisingly useful reviews *when given the right context via kit*. For simple projects, you can get decent AI code reviews for **less than $1/month**. Here's an example [against kit itself](https://github.com/cased/kit/pull/56#issuecomment-2928399599). This review cost *half a cent*.

## üéØ Key Features

### Intelligent Analysis
- **Repository Context**: Full codebase understanding, not just diff analysis
- **Symbol Analysis**: Identifies when functions/classes are used elsewhere  
- **Cross-Impact Assessment**: Understands how changes affect the broader system
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with any language kit supports

### Professional Output
- **Priority-Based Issues**: High/Medium/Low issue categorization with filtering options

- **Token Breakdown**: Understand what drives costs
- **Model Information**: Know which AI provided the analysis
- **No Hidden Fees**: Pay only for actual LLM usage

## üìã Custom Context Profiles

Store and apply **organization-specific coding standards and review guidelines** through custom context profiles. Create profiles that automatically inject your company's coding standards, security requirements, and style guidelines into every PR review.

```bash
# Create a profile from your existing coding guidelines
kit review-profile create --name company-standards \
  --file coding-guidelines.md \
  --description "Acme Corp coding standards"

# Use in any review
kit review --profile company-standards https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# List all profiles
kit review-profile list
```

## üîÑ Output Modes & Integration

Kit provides different output modes for various workflows - from direct GitHub posting to piping output to CLI code writers:

```bash
# Standard mode - posts directly to GitHub
kit review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Plain mode - clean output for piping to other tools
kit review --plain https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 | \
  claude "implement these suggestions"

# Priority filtering - focus on what matters
kit review --priority=high,medium https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

## üìà What's Next: Roadmap

#### Recently Shipped ‚úÖ
- **Custom Context Profiles**: Store and apply organization-specific coding standards and guidelines
- **Priority Filtering**: Focus reviews on what matters most

#### In Development  
- **Feedback Learning**: Simple database to learn from review feedback and improve over time
- **Inline Comments**: Post comments directly on specific lines instead of summary comments
- **Follow-up Review Awareness**: Take previous reviews into account for better, more targeted feedback

#### Future Features
- **Multi-Model Consensus**: Compare reviews from multiple models for high-stakes changes
- **Smart Review Routing**: Automatically select the best model based on change type and team preferences

## üí° Best Practices

### Cost Optimization
- **Use free local AI** for unlimited reviews with Ollama (requires self-hosted setup)
- Use budget models for routine changes, premium for breaking changes
- Use the `--model` flag to override models per PR
- Leverage caching - repeat reviews of same repo are 5-10x faster
- Set up profiles to avoid redundant context

### Team Adoption
- **Start with free local AI** to build confidence without costs
- Use budget models initially to control costs
- Create organization-specific guidelines for consistent reviews
- Add to CI/CD for all PRs or just high-impact branches
