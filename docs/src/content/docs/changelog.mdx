# Changelog

All notable changes to Kit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.3]

### New Features

- **Batch File Retrieval**: `Repository.get_file_content` now accepts a list of paths and returns a mapping of `path ‚Üí content`, eliminating the need for multiple calls when bulk loading files.
  - Backwards-compatible: single-path calls still return a plain string.

## [1.0.2]

### üîß Improvements

- **Automatic GitHub Token Pickup**: Repository class and MCP server now automatically detect GitHub tokens from environment variables
  - Checks `KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` first, then falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - Simplifies private repository access - no need to pass tokens explicitly
  - Consistent behavior across Python API and MCP server interfaces
  - Explicit token parameters still override environment variables

- **macOS Symlink Compatibility**: Fixed path validation issues on macOS for MCP server
  - Resolves `/tmp` ‚Üí `/private/tmp` symlink conflicts that caused path validation errors
  - Maintains security while ensuring compatibility with macOS filesystem structure
  - Fixes "not in subpath" errors when using Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
