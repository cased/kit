# Changelog

All notable changes to Kit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-27

### New Features

- **Dependency Analysis CLI Command**: Complete command-line interface for code dependency analysis
  - New `kit dependencies` command supporting Python and Terraform projects
  - Dependency graph generation with multiple output formats (JSON, DOT, GraphML, adjacency)
  - Circular dependency detection with detailed cycle visualization
  - Module-specific analysis with direct and indirect dependency tracking
  - LLM-friendly context generation for AI-powered dependency analysis
  - Graphviz integration for dependency visualization (PNG, SVG, PDF output)


## [1.3.3] - 2025-06-26

### Security / Bug Fixes

- **Private-repo cloning with installation tokens**: `Repository` now uses an improved `GIT_ASKPASS` helper that supplies `x-access-token` as the username and the token as the password.  
  - Fixes 404 "repository not found" errors when using GitHub App installation tokens.  
  - Backwards-compatible: personal-access tokens (PATs) continue to work unchanged.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-06-25

### Improvements

- **More actionable API errors**: REST endpoints now return precise HTTP status codes and JSON bodies.  
  - `/repository` returns `404 {"detail": "Repository not found: <url>"}` instead of a generic 500.  
  - Dependency and search endpoints propagate upstream errors for easier debugging.
- **Verbose logging**: Repository creation and search endpoints log request URLs, headers, and truncated bodies for better traceability.

## [1.3.1] - 2025-06-24

### Improvements
- **Better grep**
  - Sensible ignore directories
  - More grep options

- **Grep Command**: Fast literal text search across repository files
  - New `kit grep` command with system grep integration
  - Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search options
  - File inclusion/exclusion patterns with glob support
  - Configurable result limits and automatic .git directory exclusion
  - 30-second timeout protection for large repositories

- **File Tree Subpath Support**: Analyze specific directories within repositories
  - New `--path` option for `kit file-tree` command enables directory-specific analysis
  - Supports relative paths from repository root (e.g., `--path src/components`)
  - Compatible with existing output formats and export functionality
  - Enables focused analysis of large repository subdirectories

### Improvements

- **Path Validation**: Centralized path checking across all file operations
  - Unified validation utility prevents path traversal in user-provided file paths
  - Maintains compatibility with existing symlink handling on macOS

## [1.2.3]

### Bug Fixes

- **Duplicate TypeScript / TSX Symbols**: Resolved an issue where some symbols could be recorded twice in `symbols.json` depending on tree-sitter queries
  - The `TreeSitterSymbolExtractor` now removes duplicate symbols based on `(name, type, start_line, end_line)`
  - Added dedicated regression test suite covering TypeScript and TSX symbol deduplication

### Improvements

- **Optional Dependencies**: Made `tiktoken` dependency optional in `summaries.py` to reduce installation requirements
- **Dependency Management**: Relaxed FastAPI version constraints for better compatibility
- **Development Dependencies**: Moved linters and type checking dependencies to development group

## [1.2.2]

### Enhanced Features

  - Support for classes, functions, structs, enums, namespaces, and templates
  - Dedicated tree-sitter query patterns for C++ language constructs
  - Full integration with existing symbol extraction pipeline

## [1.2.0]

### Enhanced Repository Cache Management

- **Automatic Cache Cleanup**: Repository now accepts optional `cache_ttl_hours` argument for automatic cleanup
  - Environment variable support via `KIT_TMP_REPO_TTL_HOURS`
  - Automatically deletes cached repository clones older than TTL
  - One-shot purge per Python process using `functools.lru_cache`
  - Fallback to previous behavior when TTL is unset

  - Automatic cache invalidation on git operations (checkout, commit, merge, rebase)
  - LRU eviction with configurable cache size limits
  - New CLI commands: `kit cache status`, `kit cache clear`, `kit cache cleanup`, `kit cache stats`

### Enhanced Features

### New Features

- **Batch File Retrieval**: `Repository.get_file_content` now accepts a list of paths and returns a mapping of `path → content`, eliminating the need for multiple calls when bulk loading files.
  - Backwards-compatible: single-path calls still return a plain string.

## [1.0.2]

### Improvements

- **Automatic GitHub Token Pickup**: Repository class and MCP server now automatically detect GitHub tokens from environment variables
  - Checks `KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` first, then falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - Simplifies private repository access - no need to pass tokens explicitly
  - Consistent behavior across Python API and MCP server interfaces
  - Explicit token parameters still override environment variables

- **macOS Symlink Compatibility**: Fixed path validation issues on macOS for MCP server
  - Resolves `/tmp` → `/private/tmp` symlink conflicts that caused path validation errors
  - Maintains security while ensuring compatibility with macOS filesystem structure
  - Fixes "not in subpath" errors when using Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
