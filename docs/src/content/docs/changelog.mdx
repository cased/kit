  - `/repository` returns `404 {"detail": "Repository not found: <url>"}` instead of a generic 500.  
  - Dependency and search endpoints propagate upstream errors for easier debugging.
- **Verbose logging**: Repository creation and search endpoints log request URLs, headers, and truncated bodies for better traceability.

## [1.0.2]

### Improvements

- **Automatic GitHub Token Pickup**: Repository class and MCP server now automatically detect GitHub tokens from environment variables
  - Checks `KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` first, then falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - Simplifies private repository access - no need to pass tokens explicitly
  - Consistent behavior across Python API and MCP server interfaces
  - Explicit token parameters still override environment variables

- **macOS Symlink Compatibility**: Fixed path validation issues on macOS for MCP server
  - Resolves `/tmp` → `/private/tmp` symlink conflicts that caused path validation errors
