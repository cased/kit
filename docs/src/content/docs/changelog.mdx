# Changelog

All notable changes to Kit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0]

### Major Features

- **Incremental Analysis System**: High-performance caching for symbol extraction
  - 25x performance improvements for warm cache scenarios
  - Multi-strategy cache invalidation (mtime, size, content hash, git state detection)
  - Automatic cache invalidation on git operations (checkout, commit, merge, rebase)
  - LRU eviction with configurable cache size limits
  - New CLI commands: `kit cache status`, `kit cache clear`, `kit cache cleanup`, `kit cache stats`

### Enhanced Features

- **Dart Language Support**: Initial anguage integration with tree-sitter
  - Classes, functions, constructors, getters, setters, enums, extensions, mixins
  - Flutter widget detection patterns for StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget
  - Comprehensive symbol extraction with inheritance relationships
  - Plugin system support for custom Dart patterns

### Bug Fixes

- **Cache Invalidation Fix**: Resolved stale data issues causing incorrect line numbers
  - Repository objects now properly detect git state changes (branch switches, commits, merges)
  - Automatic cache invalidation prevents serving outdated symbol data from previous git states
  - Comprehensive git SHA tracking ensures data consistency across git operations

- **TSX Language Support**: Fixed missing TypeScript JSX support
  - Proper fallback to TypeScript queries when tsx directory doesn't exist
  - Ensures consistent symbol extraction for React TypeScript projects

## [1.0.3]

### New Features

- **Batch File Retrieval**: `Repository.get_file_content` now accepts a list of paths and returns a mapping of `path → content`, eliminating the need for multiple calls when bulk loading files.
  - Backwards-compatible: single-path calls still return a plain string.

## [1.0.2]

### Improvements

- **Automatic GitHub Token Pickup**: Repository class and MCP server now automatically detect GitHub tokens from environment variables
  - Checks `KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` first, then falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - Simplifies private repository access - no need to pass tokens explicitly
  - Consistent behavior across Python API and MCP server interfaces
  - Explicit token parameters still override environment variables

- **macOS Symlink Compatibility**: Fixed path validation issues on macOS for MCP server
  - Resolves `/tmp` → `/private/tmp` symlink conflicts that caused path validation errors
  - Maintains security while ensuring compatibility with macOS filesystem structure
  - Fixes "not in subpath" errors when using Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

## [1.2.0]

### Enhanced Repository Cache Management

- **Tmp-repo auto-cleanup**: `Repository` now accepts an optional `cache_ttl_hours` argument (or the environment variable `KIT_TMP_REPO_TTL_HOURS`).  When set, Kit will automatically delete cached clones in `/tmp/kit-repo-cache` that are older than the TTL the first time any process clones a remote repository.
  - One-shot purge per Python process (memoised with `functools.lru_cache`).
  - Detailed README and API docs updates.
  - Fallback to previous behavior when unset.
- **Logging Improvements**: Debug log emitted for invalid `KIT_TMP_REPO_TTL_HOURS` values; warnings emitted if a cached repo cannot be removed during cleanup (permissions, etc.).

### Tests

- Added `tests/test_cache_cleanup.py` covering TTL parsing, invalid env handling, and actual cleanup logic.
