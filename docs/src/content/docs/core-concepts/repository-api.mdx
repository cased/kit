title: The Repository Interface
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The `kit.Repository` object is the backbone of the library. It serves as your primary interface for accessing, analyzing, and understanding codebases, regardless of their language or location (local path or remote Git URL).

## What Can You Do with a `Repository`?

Once you instantiate a `Repository` object pointing to your target codebase:

```python
from kit import Repository

# Point to a local project
my_repo = Repository("/path/to/local/project")

# Or point to a remote GitHub repo
# github_repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/repo-name")

# Or analyze a specific version
# versioned_repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/repo-name", ref="v1.2.3")
```

You can perform various code intelligence tasks:

**Explore Structure**
- Get the file tree with `.get_file_tree()`

**Read Content**
- Access file content with `.get_file_content()`

**Understand Code**
- Extract functions, classes, and symbols with `.extract_symbols()`

**Access Git Metadata**
- Get commit SHA, branch, and remote URL with `.current_sha`, `.current_branch`, `.remote_url`

**Search & Navigate**
- Find text patterns with `.search_text()`
- Find semantically similar code with `.search_semantic()`

**Analyze Dependencies**
- Find where symbols are used with `.find_symbol_usages()`

**Prepare for LLMs**
- Chunk code by lines with `.chunk_file_by_lines()`
- Chunk code by symbols with `.chunk_file_by_symbols()`
- Get context around lines with `.extract_context_around_line()`

**Integrate with AI**
- Get configured summarizers with `.get_summarizer()`
- Get vector searchers with `.get_vector_searcher()`

**Export Data**
- Save to JSON with `.write_index()`, `.write_symbols()`, etc.

| Class/Tool         | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Summarizer`       | Generate summaries of code using LLMs          |
| `VectorSearcher`   | Query vector index of code for semantic search |
| `DocstringIndexer` | Build vector index of LLM-generated summaries  |
| `SummarySearcher`  | Query that index                               |

## Working with Multiple Repositories

When you need to analyze multiple repositories together—such as microservices, a frontend/backend split, or team projects—use `MultiRepo`:

```python
from kit import MultiRepo

repos = MultiRepo([
    "~/code/frontend",
    "~/code/backend",
    "~/code/shared-lib",
])

# Search across all repos
results = repos.search("handleAuth")

# Find symbols across repos
models = repos.find_symbol("UserModel", symbol_type="class")

# Audit dependencies for version drift
deps = repos.audit_dependencies()
```

<Aside type="tip">
  See the **[MultiRepo API Reference](/api/multi-repo/)** for full documentation including semantic search across repos, CLI commands, and dependency version drift detection.

## File and Directory Exclusion (.gitignore support)

By default, kit automatically ignores files and directories listed in your `.gitignore` as well as `.git/` and its contents. This ensures your indexes, symbol extraction, and searches do not include build artifacts, dependencies, or version control internals.

**Override:**
- This behavior is the default. If you want to include ignored files, you can override this by modifying the `RepoMapper` logic (see `src/kit/repo_mapper.py`) or subclassing it with custom exclusion rules.
