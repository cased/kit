title: File & Directory Exclusion

## File and Directory Exclusion (.gitignore support)

By default, kit automatically ignores files and directories listed in your `.gitignore` as well as `.git/` and its contents. This ensures your indexes, symbol extraction, and searches do not include build artifacts, dependencies, or version control internals.

**Override:**
- This behavior is the default. If you want to include ignored files, you can override this by modifying the `RepoMapper` logic (see `src/kit/repo_mapper.py`) or subclassing it with custom exclusion rules.
