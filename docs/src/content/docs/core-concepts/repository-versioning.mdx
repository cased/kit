One of kit's most powerful features is the ability to analyze repositories at specific points in their history. Whether you're investigating a bug that appeared in a particular release, comparing code evolution over time, or ensuring reproducible analysis results, kit's versioning capabilities provide the foundation for sophisticated historical code analysis.

## Why Analyze Different Versions?

### Release Analysis and Debugging

When investigating issues that appeared in specific releases, analyzing the exact codebase state at that time is crucial:

```python
from kit import Repository

# Analyze the codebase at a specific release
repo_v1 = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="v1.2.0")
repo_v2 = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="v1.3.0")

# Compare symbol extraction between versions
symbols_v1 = repo_v1.extract_symbols("src/core/api.py")
symbols_v2 = repo_v2.extract_symbols("src/core/api.py")

# Find new or removed functions
v1_functions = {s["name"] for s in symbols_v1 if s["type"] == "function"}
v2_functions = {s["name"] for s in symbols_v2 if s["type"] == "function"}

new_functions = v2_functions - v1_functions
removed_functions = v1_functions - v2_functions

print(f"Functions added in v1.3.0: {new_functions}")
print(f"Functions removed in v1.3.0: {removed_functions}")
```

### Reproducible Code Analysis

For documentation generation, CI/CD pipelines, or research purposes, you often need reproducible results:

```python
# Always analyze the exact same version
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="abc123def456")

# This will always return the same results, regardless of when you run it
file_tree = repo.get_file_tree()
symbols = repo.extract_symbols()

# Perfect for generating consistent documentation or reports
```

### Historical Trend Analysis

Understanding how codebases evolve over time reveals important patterns:

```python
# Analyze multiple releases to track complexity growth
releases = ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0", "v1.2.0", "v1.3.0"]
complexity_data = []

for release in releases:
    repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref=release)
    symbols = repo.extract_symbols()
    
    # Count functions and classes as a simple complexity metric
    function_count = sum(1 for s in symbols if s["type"] == "function")
    class_count = sum(1 for s in symbols if s["type"] == "class")
    
    complexity_data.append({
        "release": release,
        "functions": function_count,
        "classes": class_count,
        "total_symbols": len(symbols)
    })

print("Complexity evolution:")
for data in complexity_data:
    print(f"{data['release']}: {data['total_symbols']} symbols "
          f"({data['functions']} functions, {data['classes']} classes)")
```

### Pre-Production Analysis

Analyze feature branches or specific commits before they reach production:

```python
# Analyze a feature branch before merging
feature_repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="feature/new-api")
main_repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="main")

# Check for breaking changes
feature_symbols = feature_repo.extract_symbols("src/api/")
main_symbols = main_repo.extract_symbols("src/api/")

# Identify changes in public API
# (implementation would depend on your specific needs)
```

## Working with Different Reference Types

### Commit SHAs

The most precise way to reference a specific state:

```python
# Full SHA (40 characters)
repo = Repository(".", ref="8cf426abe80f6cd3ab02ffc6fb11b00dd60995c8")

# Short SHA (typically 7+ characters)
repo = Repository(".", ref="8cf426a")

# Access the current commit information
print(f"Analyzing commit: {repo.current_sha}")
print(f"Short SHA: {repo.current_sha_short}")
```

### Tags and Releases

Perfect for analyzing specific releases:

```python
# Semantic version tags
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="v1.2.3")

# Other tag formats
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="release-2024-01")
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="stable")

# The tag information is preserved
print(f"Analyzing version: {repo.ref}")
```

### Branches

Analyze specific development branches:

```python
# Main development branch
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="main")

# Feature branches
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="develop")
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="feature/user-auth")

# Release branches
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="release/v2.0")
```

## Accessing Git Metadata

Kit provides comprehensive access to git repository metadata:

```python
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="v1.2.3")

# Basic git information
print(f"Current SHA: {repo.current_sha}")
print(f"Short SHA: {repo.current_sha_short}")
print(f"Branch: {repo.current_branch}")
print(f"Remote URL: {repo.remote_url}")

# Check if we're on a specific ref
print(f"Requested ref: {repo.ref}")
```

This metadata is especially useful for:

- **Logging and tracking**: Record exactly what version was analyzed
- **Cache invalidation**: Use SHA as cache keys for computed results
- **Audit trails**: Maintain records of what code was analyzed when
- **Validation**: Ensure you're analyzing the expected version

## Practical Examples

### Documentation Generation Workflow

```python
def generate_api_docs(repo_url: str, version: str):
    """Generate API documentation for a specific version."""
    repo = Repository(repo_url, ref=version)
    
    # Extract all public API symbols
    api_symbols = []
    for symbol in repo.extract_symbols():
        if symbol["type"] in ["function", "class"] and not symbol["name"].startswith("_"):
            api_symbols.append(symbol)
    
    # Generate documentation
    docs = {
        "version": version,
        "commit": repo.current_sha,
        "generated_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "api_reference": api_symbols
    }
    
    return docs

# Generate docs for multiple versions
for version in ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0", "v1.2.0"]:
    docs = generate_api_docs("https://github.com/owner/project", version)
    with open(f"docs/api-{version}.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(docs, f, indent=2)
```

### Security Audit Across Versions

```python
def audit_security_patterns(repo_url: str, versions: list):
    """Audit security patterns across multiple versions."""
    security_patterns = [
        r"password\s*=",
        r"api_key\s*=",
        r"secret\s*=",
        r"eval\s*\(",
        r"exec\s*\("
    ]
    
    results = {}
    
    for version in versions:
        repo = Repository(repo_url, ref=version)
        version_results = []
        
        for pattern in security_patterns:
            matches = repo.search_text(pattern, file_pattern="*.py")
            if matches:
                version_results.extend(matches)
        
        results[version] = {
            "commit": repo.current_sha,
            "issues_found": len(version_results),
            "details": version_results
        }
    
    return results

# Audit recent releases
audit_results = audit_security_patterns(
    "https://github.com/owner/project",
    ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0", "v1.2.0"]
)
```

### Migration Impact Analysis

```python
def analyze_migration_impact(repo_url: str, before_ref: str, after_ref: str):
    """Analyze the impact of a major change or migration."""
    
    before_repo = Repository(repo_url, ref=before_ref)
    after_repo = Repository(repo_url, ref=after_ref)
    
    # Compare file structures
    before_files = {f["path"] for f in before_repo.get_file_tree() if not f["is_dir"]}
    after_files = {f["path"] for f in after_repo.get_file_tree() if not f["is_dir"]}
    
    # Compare symbols
    before_symbols = {s["name"] for s in before_repo.extract_symbols()}
    after_symbols = {s["name"] for s in after_repo.extract_symbols()}
    
    return {
        "files": {
            "added": after_files - before_files,
            "removed": before_files - after_files,
            "total_before": len(before_files),
            "total_after": len(after_files)
        },
        "symbols": {
            "added": after_symbols - before_symbols,
            "removed": before_symbols - after_symbols,
            "total_before": len(before_symbols),
            "total_after": len(after_symbols)
        },
        "metadata": {
            "before_commit": before_repo.current_sha,
            "after_commit": after_repo.current_sha
        }
    }

# Analyze impact of a major refactoring
impact = analyze_migration_impact(
    "https://github.com/owner/project",
    "v1.x-legacy",
    "v2.0-rewrite"
)
```

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Reference Type

- **Use commit SHAs** for maximum precision and immutability
- **Use tags** for analyzing specific releases or versions
- **Use branches** for analyzing ongoing development work
- **Avoid branch names** for long-term storage/caching (they move over time)

### Performance Considerations

```python
# Cache Repository instances when analyzing multiple aspects of the same version
repo = Repository("https://github.com/owner/project", ref="v1.2.3")

# Do multiple operations on the same repo instance
file_tree = repo.get_file_tree()
symbols = repo.extract_symbols()
search_results = repo.search_text("TODO")

# Rather than creating separate instances for each operation
```

### Error Handling

```python
def safe_repo_analysis(repo_url: str, ref: str):
    """Safely analyze a repository with proper error handling."""
    try:
        repo = Repository(repo_url, ref=ref)
        
        # Verify we got the expected ref
        if repo.current_sha is None:
            raise ValueError("Repository has no git metadata")
            
        return {
            "success": True,
            "sha": repo.current_sha,
            "symbols": repo.extract_symbols()
        }
        
    except ValueError as e:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": f"Invalid ref '{ref}': {e}"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": f"Analysis failed: {e}"
        }
```

<Aside type="tip">
**Repository Identity**: When using the REST API, repositories are identified by a deterministic ID that includes both path and ref. This means `repo@main` and `repo@v1.0.0` are treated as separate repositories, enabling precise caching and avoiding confusion between versions.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
**Git Requirements**: To use ref parameters with local repositories, the directory must be a git repository. For remote repositories, kit will clone the repository at the specified ref automatically.
</Aside>

## Integration with Other Kit Features

### CLI Usage with Versions

All kit CLI commands support the `--ref` parameter:

```bash
# Analyze symbols at a specific version
kit symbols https://github.com/owner/repo --ref v1.2.3

# Compare file trees between versions
kit file-tree https://github.com/owner/repo --ref v1.0.0 --output v1-files.json
kit file-tree https://github.com/owner/repo --ref v2.0.0 --output v2-files.json

# Export data for external analysis
kit export https://github.com/owner/repo symbols v1-symbols.json --ref v1.0.0
```

### REST API Versioning

The REST API maintains separate repository instances for different refs:

```bash
# Create repository instances for different versions
curl -X POST localhost:8000/repository \
  -d '{"path_or_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo", "ref": "v1.0.0"}'
# Returns: {"id": "abc123"}

curl -X POST localhost:8000/repository \
  -d '{"path_or_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo", "ref": "v2.0.0"}'
# Returns: {"id": "def456"}  // Different ID for different ref

# Access git metadata
curl localhost:8000/repository/abc123/git-info
```

### MCP Server Capabilities

The MCP server exposes versioning capabilities to AI agents:

```json
{
  "tool": "open_repository",
  "arguments": {
    "path_or_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
    "ref": "v1.2.3"
  }
}
```

This enables AI agents to perform sophisticated historical analysis and version comparison tasks automatically.

Repository versioning in kit provides the foundation for building sophisticated code analysis tools that can work across time, enabling everything from bug archaeology to compliance auditing to automated documentation generation.
